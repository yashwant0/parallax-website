            During these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic
            behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the flourishing web development
            scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They
            pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming
            language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.[6]

            Netscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax
            similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages.[5][6] Although the new language
            and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in
            September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.[6][1][14]

            The choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. At the
            time, the dot-com boom had begun and Java was the hot new language, so Eich considered the JavaScript name a
            marketing ploy by Netscape.[15]
            During the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s, client-side scripting was stagnant.
            This started to change in 2004, when the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser.
            Firefox was well received by many, taking significant market share from Internet Explorer.[21]

            In 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on the ECMAScript for XML (E4X) standard. This
            led to Mozilla working jointly with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were implementing E4X
            in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an ECMAScript 4 draft. The goal became standardizing
            ActionScript 3 as the new ECMAScript 4. To this end, Adobe Systems released the Tamarin implementation as an
            open source project. However, Tamarin and ActionScript 3 were too different from established client-side
            scripting, and without cooperation from Microsoft, ECMAScript 4 never reached fruition.
